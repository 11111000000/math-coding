(* MC-AMBIGUOUS-ACCEPTANCE: emitted by the conformance runner when

   OCAML_BEST_PRACTICES §9.1 the verifier shape is preferred and

(* MC-* code registry used by `mathc explain-diagnostic <CODE>`.
   Each entry is a markdown body with three sections, delimited
   by `### Definition` / `### Occurs when` / `### Remediation`
   (the binary CLI parses the body into those three fields and
   emits them as JSON keys). The whitelist mirrors the codes
   emitted by `bin/Mathc.ml:validate_with_counts` and the
   conformance runner in `lib/decision.ml`. Adding a new code
   to the kernel without registering it here leaves the CLI
   unable to describe a code it itself emits; the registry
   and the emitter MUST be updated together (see
   decisions/plan-2026-10-improvements/t4-2.yaml reversal

         An obligation's acceptance list contains an item with both\n\
         `verifier` + `result` AND `review` fields.\n\n\
         ### Occurs when\n\
         The kernel parses the verifier-half successfully and the\n\
         review-half is silently dropped (per\n\
         OCAML_BEST_PRACTICES §9.1 the verifier shape wins).\n\
         Surfaced by `mathc validate` as an extra Warn diagnostic\n\
         on the `accept` verdict.\n\n\
         ### Remediation\n\
         Remove either the `verifier`/`result` block or the `review`\n\

         An acceptance item has the right field structure\n\

         — e.g., `result: bogus` instead of `pass`/`fail`/\n\
         `inconclusive`/`infrastructure-error`.\n\n\
         ### Occurs when\n\
         `mathc validate` walks every acceptance and reports each\n\
         unparseable item. The verdict is still `accept` because\n\
         the kernel typed the rest of the decision; the\n\
         diagnostic tells the author the malformed item is ignored.\n\n\

         next step. Exit code is 1.\n\n\

         verdict stays `accept` (counterexample is a dialectical\n\
         slot, not a hard requirement) so legacy decisions stay\n\
         valid. The diagnostic reminds the author to add it.\n\n\
